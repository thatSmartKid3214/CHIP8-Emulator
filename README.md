A chip8 emulator that was developed in 2 days.

Only works for Windows.

Requires SDL3 to compile and run.

You can build it using the python file "build.py".

Issues:
- Runs slow
- Sometimes fails to accuraltely emulate some roms.
- No way to switch roms, you will have to recompile each time you want to run a new ROM(will fix)
